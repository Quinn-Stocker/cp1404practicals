# Estimates:
The most significant estimates that I used throughout the practical tasks was the formatting and naming conventions
these however did not change significantly, excluding the points in which I tried to reflect on my own code, this was
due to the lack of Code Reviews.

# Code Reviews:
In the context of learning from doing code reviews and getting code reviews,
I have learned only a small amount, mainly about proper formatting,
this is due to the fact That in total I have only gotten 1 code review request and 1 code review.
[The only Code Review Request I got](https://github.com/qbouet/cp1404practicals/pull/6#event-11002775518)

# Changes:
Primarily due to my lack of Code Reviews, the significant thing that I would change about the subject
would be ways to ensure that people would be getting code reviews, for example making the list of code reviewers
dynamically change, rather than choosing them all at the start, as this would allow pairings that will allow anyone
who participates to be able to actually participate.
